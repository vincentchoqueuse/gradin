        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>Privacy First:</strong> Gradin is built with privacy at its core. All your data stays on your device and your personal iCloud (if enabled). We never access, collect, or share your information with third parties.
        </div>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how Gradin ("we," "our," or "the app") handles your information. Gradin is designed to give you complete control over your data with no server-side collection or processing.
        </p>

        <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>Gradin does not collect, transmit, or have access to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Student names, emails, or identification numbers</li>
            <li>Student photos or personal information</li>
            <li>Assessment data, grades, or comments</li>
            <li>Course information or learning outcomes</li>
            <li>Usage analytics or tracking data</li>
            <li>Device information or identifiers</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Any personal information whatsoever</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Your Data Is Stored</h2>

        <h3>Local Storage</h3>
        <p>
            All data you enter into Gradin is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Student Information:</strong> Names, emails, school IDs, groups, and optional photos</li>
            <li><strong>Course Data:</strong> Course names, levels, dates, and associated information</li>
            <li><strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> Outcome definitions, criteria, and validation thresholds</li>
            <li><strong>Assessments:</strong> Grades, comments, and assessment dates</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>iCloud Storage (Optional)</h3>
        <p>
            Gradin offers optional iCloud synchronization through Apple's CloudKit service. When enabled:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your data is encrypted and stored in <strong>your personal iCloud account</strong></li>
            <li>Data syncs automatically across your devices signed in with the same Apple ID</li>
            <li>We have no access to your iCloud data</li>
            <li>iCloud sync can be disabled at any time in the app's Settings</li>
            <li>Apple's iCloud terms and privacy policy apply to cloud-stored data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Photo Library Access</h2>
        <p>
            Gradin requests access to your photo library solely to allow you to select student photos for identification purposes. When you grant photo access:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can select individual photos to associate with student profiles</li>
            <li>Photos are stored locally on your device using external storage for efficiency</li>
            <li>Photos are never uploaded to our servers (we don't have servers)</li>
            <li>If iCloud sync is enabled, photos sync to your personal iCloud account</li>
            <li>You can deny photo access and the app will function normally without student photos</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Exports</h2>
        <p>
            Gradin allows you to export your data in CSV format. When you export:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data is saved as a file on your device</li>
            <li>You control where the file is saved and who has access to it</li>
            <li>No data is transmitted to us or any third party during export</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>QR Code Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            Gradin includes an optional feature that allows teachers to share student progress or assessment summaries
            via a QR code. This QR code encodes a pre-formatted email containing the selected information.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The QR code is generated locally on the teacher’s device — no data is uploaded or transmitted externally.</li>
            <li>When a student scans the QR code, their device opens their default mail app with a pre-filled message containing the information.</li>
            <li>The student can review, edit, or delete the message before sending it — <strong>no email is sent automatically.</strong></li>
            <li>This mechanism ensures full user control and transparency over what data is shared and when.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This design follows the principle of <strong>privacy by design</strong> — all data sharing is voluntary, explicit, and initiated by the user.
            No data is collected, stored, or transmitted by Gradin or any third-party service.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Imports</h2>
        <p>
            You can import student data from CSV files. When you import:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data is read from the file you select and stored locally in the app</li>
            <li>The original file is not modified</li>
            <li>No data is transmitted to us or any third party during import</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Rights and Control</h2>

        <h3>Data Ownership</h3>
        <p>
            You own all data you enter into Gradin. We never claim ownership or access to your information.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Access</h3>
        <p>
            You have complete access to all your data at all times through the app interface and can export it to CSV format.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Deletion</h3>
        <p>
            You can delete any data within the app:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Delete individual assessments, students, outcomes, or courses</li>
            <li>Uninstall the app to permanently delete all local data</li>
            <li>Disable iCloud sync and manually delete data from iCloud settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Portability</h3>
        <p>
            Export your data to CSV format at any time for use in other systems or backup purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>Educational Privacy Compliance</h2>

        <h3>FERPA Compliance (United States)</h3>
        <p>
            Gradin complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) because:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All data is stored locally under the teacher's control</li>
            <li>We do not access, process, or store student educational records</li>
            <li>Teachers maintain full control over data access and sharing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>GDPR Compliance (European Union)</h3>
        <p>
            Gradin complies with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) because:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We are not a data controller or processor (no data collection)</li>
            <li>Users have complete control over their data (right to access)</li>
            <li>Users can delete all data at any time (right to erasure)</li>
            <li>Users can export data in a standard format (right to data portability)</li>
            <li>No profiling or automated decision-making occurs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Gradin is designed for use by teachers and educators, not by children. While the app may store information about students (including minors), it does not collect this data from children directly. Teachers are responsible for ensuring they have appropriate authorization to maintain student records.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Gradin does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The only third-party service is Apple's CloudKit (if iCloud sync is enabled), which is covered by Apple's privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            Data security is provided by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>iOS Encryption:</strong> All local data is protected by iOS device encryption</li>
            <li><strong>iCloud Encryption:</strong> Cloud data is encrypted by Apple's CloudKit service</li>
            <li><strong>No Network Transmission:</strong> No data is sent to external servers</li>
            <li><strong>Device Protection:</strong> Standard iOS security features (Face ID, Touch ID, passcode) protect access to the app</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
        </p>
